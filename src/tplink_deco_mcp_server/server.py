This MCP provides access to a TP-Link Deco mesh Wi-Fi network on the local network.

Use it when the user asks about their home network, Wi-Fi, router, internet connection, or the \
devices connected to it: who is online, which device uses bandwidth, which IP a device has, \
renaming devices, blocking a device from the internet, reserving a fixed IP, or diagnosing an \
outage.

Devices are identified by MAC address. When the user names a device, call `list_clients` first \
to resolve its MAC. Tools that change settings apply immediately on the router.\
